# Tkinter Database Task

A school assignment for the databases topic, with the use of Tkinter.

System for running a small sweetshop. Capacity to create, view, edit and delete customers, orders, products and suppliers. Links created between them all. Databases in 3NF (3rd Normal Form).

Looks terrible, but we skip over that part.
